Bugs:
- If images are loaded containing black colours (0) they are displayed
incorrectly.
- Grayscale displaying of images on non datapixx enabled monitors is creating
green tinted images.
- Currently, images without an alpha channel cannot be handled by hrl.
- It seems as though image handling is slow when filenames are given to HRL as
opposed to numpy arrays. This would seem to be because the file is being loaded
inside of a loop in a way that it shouldn't be.
- In general, image handling is kind of borked at the moment, it seems.

Documentation:
- Better documentation of experiment and reviewing of current library
documentation. A general review/refactoring should probably be done.

Features:
- Add minolta photometer to HRL API
- Add the ability to draw text objects with HRL as well
- Allow a setting of minimum and maximum lookup table values, returning
maximum linear resolution, maybe with visualiziation and hints and such
- Develop new C wrapper.

Tasks:
- Monitor tests?
