check_monitor_rate.py  measures the refresh rate of the Siemens monitor.
Its nominal rate is 130 Hz. 

- Note that in nvidia-settings one should unclick the 'sync to  vblank' for
the measurement to work. No idea why it should be unchecked.
in the menu the option is found in "X Screen 1" and then "X Server XVideo Settings"


One can temporarily stop the OS services that could be time critical (cron, etc).
In the home folder (/home/experimenter/) the scrip to stop services is
sudo ./services.sh

to restart the services, sudo ./restart_services.sh


I did measurements (2019-07-04) with and without services, no difference in number of dropped frames
BUT difference in refresh rate. Rate closer to nominal when services are OFF.

The script gave consistently 1 dropped frame around frame 917 - 925, that is 
around 7 seconds after start of the test. I dont know why this frame is dropped at that time, systematically.
Otherwise test pass, having 1 dropped frame on 30 seconds (130*30) of stimulus presentation.
