"""
The Graphics module provides classes which allow the presentation of images in
HRL. Image presentation in HRL can be understood as a multi step process as
follows:

    Bitmap image (The image written in an 8 bit, 4 channel format)
    -> Greyscale Array (A numpy array of doubles between 0 and 1)
    -> Processed Greyscale Array (possible remapping with a lookup table)
    -> Display List (Saved to graphics memory as a 'Display List')
    -> OpenGL Texture (Returned as a a python class instance which can be drawn) 

The conversion of Bitmaps to Greyscale arrays is handled by functions in
'hrl.graphics.auxilliary' (it is, however, recommended where possible to bypass this step
and work directly with numpy arrays).

The conversion of Greyscale Arrays to Processed Greyscale Arrays is handled by
the base 'hrl' class, and consists primarily of gamma correction and contrast
range selection.

The conversion of Processed Greyscale Arrays as OpenGL Display Lists and python Texture
instances is handled by the functionality provided by this module.

This module comes with two classes. Firstly, the abstract class 'Graphics' specifies the
interface for graphics hardware in HRL. Secondly, the 'Texture' class is essentially a
OpenGL wrapper for certain OpenGL functions for the easy display of 2d images.

Texture objects are not meant to be created on their own, but are instead
created via the 'newTexture' method of Graphics. Graphics.newTexture will take
the given Processed Greyscale Array (with other optional arguments as well),
and transform it into a Texture instance, saving it in an internal list as well.
Texture instances have a 'draw' method which uses OpenGL to display the texture
via the specified hardware (e.g. gpu or datapixx).

The openGL code was based largely on a great tutorial by a mysterious tutor
here: http://disruption.ca/gutil/introduction.html
